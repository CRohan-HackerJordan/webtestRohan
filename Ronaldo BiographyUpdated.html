his first World Cup goal. In the match against England, Ronaldo's teammate at Manchester United, Wayne Rooney, was sent off. Ronaldo went up to the referee and 
appeared to ask the ref to give a red card to Rooney. Rooney pushed Ronaldo as he was talking to the ref. After Rooney left the pitch, Ronaldo was caught on camera 
winking at the Portugal bench.[62] Even though the referee said Rooney would've gotten the red card if Ronaldo complained or not, these actions caused a lot of fans 
to hate Ronaldo because they believed he influenced the referee's decision.[63]
Ronaldo became captain of Portugal for the first time in a friendly game against Brazil on 6 February 2007. At Euro 2008, he scored one goal against Czech Republic. 
Portugal were eliminated in the quarter-finals by barely losing to Germany 3-2.[64] In the 2010 World Cup, Ronaldo only scored one goal in a 7-0 win against North

2014, and 2018.
In June 2019, Ronaldo won the UEFA Nations League with Portugal to give him his second international title. In the final, Portugal beat The Netherlands 1-0.
Playing style
Ronaldo is able to play on both wings and also as a striker since he is very strong with both feet, even though he is naturally right footed.[72] He is also one of 
the world's fastest players.[73][74] He has good heading ability because he is over 6 feet tall and jumps high. He is also known for his powerful "knuckleball" 
free kicks. The "knuckleball" technique is when the ball spins very little and creates an unpredictable motion. He combines this with his powerful shot, making it 
hard for goalkeepers to stop his shots. Ronaldo has also been known for his dribbling, as he likes to do many tricks and feints with the ball to pass defenders, such 
as the step-over.[75] When he was at Manchester United, he would play as a winger and try to send crosses into the middle. At Real Madrid, he changed his playing 
style by moving more towards the middle and becoming more of a striker. He also focused more on scoring goals.[76] When he arrived to Juventus, he stayed with this 
playing style of being a goal scorer and target man, although he dribbled with the ball more because he sometimes liked to play his traditional winger position and go 
one-on-one with defenders. He also sent crosses more frequently than he did in his last few seasons at Real Madrid.
Reception
Ronaldo has been criticized for "diving" by many people, including his Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson.[78][79] He has also been criticized for being 
arrogant, such as complaining for not receiving set-pieces (free-kicks and penalties) when he gets fouled, having too much self-confidence, not celebrating with 
teammates after scoring goals, and getting excessively angry with others after losing.[80][81] Examples of this are when he threw a reporter's microphone into a lake 
before a UEFA Euro 2016 match,[82] and negative comments made at the Iceland national team after playing against them.[83]
Personal life
Ronaldo's father, José Aveiro, died of liver disease at age 52 in September 2005. Ronaldo was 20 years old at the time.[84] Ronaldo said that he does not like to 
drink alcohol, mostly because of his dad's death, but has on some very few occasions.[85]
In 2006, Ronaldo opened his first fashion boutique under the name "CR7" (his initials and shirt number) on the island he was born in, Madeira. He opened a second 
boutique in Lisbon in 2008,[86] and a third in 2009, located in Madrid.[87] In December 2013, Ronaldo opened his own museum called Museu CR7, which has all of his 
trophies and awards from his career.[88]
Ronaldo became a father on 17 June 2010. He had a son, named Cristiano Jr. He was born in the United States through an American surrogate he met in a restaurant, 
and Ronaldo announced that he had full custody. Ronaldo has never publicly revealed information about his son's mother, but he says he will reveal it to Cristiano Jr. 
when he gets older. On 8 June 2017, Ronaldo confirmed on social media that he had become the father to twins, Mateo and Eva. They were born in the United States to a 
surrogate mother.[89][90] In November 2017, his girlfriend Georgina Rodriguez gave birth to their first daughter, Alana.[91]
Ronaldo has had many relationships. He was in a relationship with Russian model Irina Shayk from 2010–2015.[92] In 2016, he began to date Spanish model Georgina 
Rodriguez. They were publicly seen for the first time at Disneyland Paris in November 2016.
Ronaldo is a Roman Catholic. He does not have tattoos because it would prevent him from donating blood.[93] On 9 November 2015, a movie about his lifestyle and his 
career was released. The title of the movie is Ronaldo.[94][95]
On 29 March 2017, Madeira Airport was renamed to Cristiano Ronaldo International Airport. A bust of Ronaldo was also revealed as part of the official renaming ceremony.
He is currently the most followed Instagram user, with over 200 million followers as of February 2020.[97] He passed Selena Gomez as the most followed person in 
October 2018, with 144 million followers.
Legal Issues
In June 2018, Ronaldo was given a suspended jail sentence of 2 years and a fine of €18.8 million for tax evasion.
In 2017, a woman claimed she was raped by Ronaldo at a hotel in Las Vegas in June 2009.[101] Many articles state that Ronaldo and the woman both met each other at the 
nightclub of the hotel. Ronaldo later invited her to his suite, and that was where the rape occurred. Ronaldo paid that woman $375,000 to stay quiet, and  
was made between Ronaldo's lawyers and the woman's lawyers that if she publicly shared information of what happened, she had to pay those $375,000 back. Ronaldo
himself denies raping the woman and calls it "fake news". In July 2019, prosecutors said they would not charge Ronaldo because there was not enough evidence.
